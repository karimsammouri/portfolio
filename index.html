                <div class="story">
                    Born on December 21, 2001 in the capital of Saudi Arabia, I had a diverse upbringing. My father
                    moved with his family
                    to Saudi from Lebanon when he was eight. My mother traveled to Saudi from the Philippines after
                    obtaining her nursing degree to meet the demand for nurses. Growing up, I attended private
                    international institutions from kindergarten to high school. It was the norm to have over ten
                    nationalities represented in every class. As I grew more globally aware, I realized how
                    privileged I
                    was to have had such a dynamic upbringing. My life required me to work with diversity and adapt
                    to
                    change, preparing me for a globalized and interconnected world.
                    <br><br>
                    As an eight-year-old, I used to play FarmTown on my father’s Facebook and work laptop.
                    He
                    eventually got me my own Facebook account (against their age policy) and a complimentary Toshiba. I recall the first time I explored
                    my newly created account. Facebook suggested that I add my favorite older cousin Lama as a
                    friend. I recall
                    wondering whether my new Toshiba had psychic abilities as I had longed to talk to her. I ended up
                    chatting with her in real-time despite her being hundreds of miles away across international
                    borders.
                    <br><br>
                    A few days later, I stumbled upon Windows XP’s text-to-speech program in the Control
                    Panel.
                    I remember my parents’ reaction as I intentionally made my inanimate laptop read slightly
                    inappropriate sentences aloud. My father was certainly questioning his decision to purchase me a Toshiba. As an eight-year-old,
                    on
                    the other hand, I was starting to think my Toshiba was supernatural. I became
                    hooked
                    to my Toshiba and its seemingly limitless potential.
                    <br><br>
                    Today, I’ve just graduated with a Bachelor’s in Computer Science from Miami University (Oxford, Ohio). I’ve
                    been
                    exposed to the breadth of the field, from systems and cloud computing to cybersecurity
                    and
                    blockchain. This breadth
                    has allowed me to develop a sense of my specific passion within the field: Artificial Intelligence (AI). To dive 
                    deeper into AI, I've decided to further my studies with a Master's in Computer Science. To that end, I was granted 
                    a full graduate assistantship (GA) at Miami University to simultaneously pursue my degree and work on my research interests.
                    <br><br>
                    I believe the future of software lies at its intersection with AI. For
                    example, I think
                    Natural Language Processing (NLP) can help bridge the current gap in the accuracy and
                    reliability of language
                    translation software. Translators currently on the market, including Google’s, are unreliable
                    and don’t effectively integrate word context and idioms, often producing sentences that are nonsensical to native speakers. By equipping translators
                    with
                    the ability to recognize word patterns, NLP has the potential to bridge the gap and usher in the
                    next generation of translators.
                    <br><br>
                    Put simply, AI opens up a whole new world of possibilities.
