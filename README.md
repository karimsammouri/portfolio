<h1>Personal Website and Portfolio</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Details my story and serves as a central hub for my online presence, providing links to my resume, LinkedIn, and GitHub. 
Built using HTML, CSS, Sass, Visual Studio Code, and GitHub Pages for hosting. Makes use of CSS <i>Media Queries</i> for page 
responsiveness and dynamic adaptation to varying window sizes. This project is wholly designed and implemented by me with all 
rights reserved. The following samples are based on screenshots taken on Safari running on a 2019 15-inch Macbook Pro.</p>
  
<h2>Landing Section</h2>
<p>Notice how the section's layout changes as the window's width is shrunk down.
